# Training Details

Training was done on the pre-trained YOLO v8.x model on Google Colaboratory using it's GPU Backend Engine. (VRAM : 15 GB)

Model was trained on the X_123_5Star-1 Dataset which has 3300 images. It has been trained for 100 Epochs.

UPTO EPOCH 35
The model has consistently reduced its Box Losses, Classification Losses and DFL Losses. Precision, Recall have improved. mAP50 and mAP50-90 have improved alongside the training metrics indicating
no signs of overfitting.

UPTO EPOCH 70
Model has been improving for a while now. Reductions in losses and improvements in precision have co-incided

FINAL :
Model peaked around Epoch 80 although it will not be used. 

Training on the 660 image "football player-detection" dataset has revealed a world of improvement to results. Therefore, it will be the model going forward
100 Epochs were run and the "best.pt" file was chosen afterwards.
